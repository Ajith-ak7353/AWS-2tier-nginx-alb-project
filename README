AWS High Availability Web Application with ALB, Monitoring & Automation
project  Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Highly Available, Automated, and Monitored Web Application Infrastructure on AWS Cloud.

The architecture ensures:

High Availability across multiple Availability Zones

Load-balanced traffic distribution

Automated monitoring & alerting

Scheduled cost optimization

Serverless automation using AWS Lambda

Centralized monitoring dashboard

This project simulates a production-grade DevOps deployment environment.

🏗 Architecture Overview

Architecture Components:

Custom VPC (CIDR: 10.0.0.0/22)

2 Public Subnets (Different Availability Zones)

2 EC2 Instances (Nginx installed)

Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Target Group

CloudWatch Alarms

AWS Lambda (Automation)

EventBridge (Scheduling)

SNS (Email Notifications)

S3 Bucket (Application Storage)

CloudWatch Dashboard

🔧 Technologies Used

AWS EC2

AWS VPC

Application Load Balancer (ALB)

AWS CloudWatch

AWS Lambda

Amazon EventBridge

Amazon SNS

Amazon S3

Nginx

Linux (Ubuntu)

🛠 Implementation Details
1️⃣ Network Setup

Created a custom VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/22

Created 2 public subnets in different Availability Zones

Attached Internet Gateway

Configured Route Tables

Configured Security Groups for HTTP & SSH access

2️⃣ EC2 Deployment

Launched 2 EC2 instances in different Availability Zones

Installed Nginx on both instances

Deployed two different web applications:

VM1 → Web App 1

VM2 → Web App 2

Verified application accessibility via public IP

3️⃣ Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Created ALB to distribute incoming traffic

Created Target Group

Registered both EC2 instances

Configured Health Checks

Verified round-robin traffic distribution

4️⃣ Monitoring & Alerting

Created CloudWatch alarm:

Trigger condition: CPU Utilization > 70%

Configured SNS Topic for email notifications

Subscribed email to SNS topic

Verified alert delivery

5️⃣ Automation Using Lambda

Developed Lambda functions to:

Automatically stop EC2 instance when CPU exceeds threshold

Send notification upon instance state change

Start/Stop instances programmatically

This ensures:

Protection against overload

Controlled infrastructure behavior

6️⃣ Scheduled Cost Optimization

Used Amazon EventBridge to:

Start EC2 instances at 9:00 AM

Stop EC2 instances at 5:00 PM

Send notification on start/stop

This simulates office-hour infrastructure usage to reduce cost.

7️⃣ CloudWatch Dashboard

Created a custom CloudWatch dashboard to monitor:

CPU Utilization

Instance Status

Alarm State

Provides centralized visibility for infrastructure health.

8️⃣ S3 Integration

Stored web application files in S3 bucket

Used S3 as centralized storage

Ensured proper IAM permissions

📊 Key DevOps Concepts Demonstrated

High Availability Architecture

Load Balancing

Infrastructure Monitoring

Alerting & Notifications


Scheduled Infrastructure Management

Observability


IAM roles for EC2 & Lambda

Principle of Least Privilege


📈 Outcome
✔ Achieved highly available architecture
✔ Implemented automated monitoring & alerting
✔ Reduced operational cost using scheduling
✔ Enabled centralized observability
✔ Built production-like DevOps environment
